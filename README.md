# 👋 Hey I'm Tanush!
## 🐉 About me
I am an undergraduate student at the **City University of Hong Kong**, majoring in **Computer and Data Engineering**, having recently completed an exchange semester at **Drexel University** in Philadelphia, PA. I have a strong background within computer science, computer engineering and data science backed through my various experiences. These focus areas include working with Python, C++, Java, R, UX/UI Design, Javascript, ReactJS, NextJS, RubyOnRails and RESTfulAPIs, as well as instructing tech bootcamps in Python, Chatbot Development, Web Development and Lua Programming to younger individuals! I am also a video editor and love creating different kinds of videos!

I love contributing to and leading new innovative tech solutions, whether it be through hackathons or internships, I am always looking to make a mark through technology in different industries. This passion has brought me to some of my notable exepriences that include a full stack software engineering and data experience through my internship at an edtech company, Preface, a fintech fellowship at Bloomberg and becoming Champion and Most Creative award winners at my university's hackathon.
